# The Go Programming Language

### Alan A. A. Donovan

### Brian W. Kernighan

This repo is a collection of code snippets written as I read through the above book. The Go Programming Language is excellently written and approaches the language in an intuitive way. I have found it invaluable while working on learning the Go programming language.

The book has a website, which you can find [here](https://www.gopl.io/ "The Go Programming Language, by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan").

That Brian W. Kernighan had written a book on Go was one of the reasons I initially decided to consider Go when looking at programming languages to learn. Before learning Go I had learned Python and Javascript, NodeJS, and frameworks such as [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/ "A framework for Vue which supports SSR among other things.").
